Step 1: List all of the puppets you want to check for possabile donations in the names_list.csv one per line (right over my exmaple ones)

Step 2: Click and run The Great Giveaway.exe

Step 3: Type in your nations name, This program will use the API so make sure you are not running any other Nationstates like programs (got issues, auto log in, etc)

Step 4: Wait and let the program list your cards, as an extra perk the program will produce a full list of links to all of the cards your puppets own (cards_list.txt)

Step 5: If the program found any matches it will print those out.  (Ex: 9006 Wants: https://www.nationstates.net/page=deck/card=85949/season=1)

Step 6: Open Gift Report.txt

Step 7: If any matches were found they will show up here as well as give you a block to copy and paste into the fourm 

Step 8: Copy and paste your special block in the thread and make sure to gift the donated card to the correct nation.  Once that is done the guild master will give you credit accordingly. 

Step 9: Enjoy the comfy feeling you get from donating cards to a good cause and helping other players complete their collections.


This program is allowed to be distrubeted as is and is run by the user at their own risk if you are handing this code out to others link them to the github and make sure that I (9003) am credited.  
Otherwise you are free to alter and use this as you would like.
